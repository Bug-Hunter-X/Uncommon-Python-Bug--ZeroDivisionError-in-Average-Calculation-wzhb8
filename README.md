This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to a `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of a list of numbers in Python.  The bug occurs when dealing with an empty list.  The provided solution gracefully handles the empty list case by returning 0 instead of raising an exception. The included files demonstrate the buggy code and its corrected version.
